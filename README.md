Most people know the importance of first aid and healthcare knowledge to them, but most of them do not take action to learn it. In recent years, people started looking into this issue and are more concerned about their health since they cannot go to the clinic or hospital frequently to avoid getting the Covid-19. On the other hand, in some families, there are some family members with diseases such as Diabetes or High Blood Pressure and they need to constantly monitor their blood sugar level or blood pressure level to know their health condition. Doctors may also need their health reports to give the prescription to them. However, there are some first aid and mobile healthcare applications in the market that only focus on one functionality such as first aid learning or blood sugar lever tracker, but there is no mobile application that includes all of these functionalities. Some of these applications may need the users to subscribe to use their services and some of them are not user-friendly and need to be tech-savvy to use them.

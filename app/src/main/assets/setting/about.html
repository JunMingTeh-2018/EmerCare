    Founded in <b>2022-03-02</b> by <b>Teh Jun Ming (Bryan)</b>, EmerCare has come a long way from
    its beginnings in 81300 located in <b>Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾</b>. When Bryan first started out, our
    passion for First Aid drove us to start our own mobile application.

    Most people know the importance of first aid and healthcare knowledge to them, but most of them
    do not take action to learn it. In recent years, people started looking into this issue and are
    more concerned about their health since they cannot go to the clinic or hospital frequently to
    avoid getting the Covid-19. On the other hand, in some families, there are some family members
    with diseases such as Diabetes or High Blood Pressure and they need to constantly monitor their
    blood sugar level or blood pressure level to know their health condition. Doctors may also need
    their health reports to give the prescription to them. However, there are some first aid and
    healthcare mobile applications in the market that only focus on one functionality such as first
    aid learning or blood sugar lever tracker, but there is no mobile application that includes all
    of these functionalities. Some of these applications may need the users to subscribe to use
    their services and some of them are not user-friendly and need to be tech-savvy to use them. The
    objective of First Aid and Healthcare Mobile Application: <b>EmerCare</b> is to promote first
    aid and healthcare knowledge and to provide a free and user-friendly health tracker for users.
    Besides, this project aims to develop an application that users just have to download one
    application and they can have functions that can be used during emergencies as well as daily
    healthcare. Hence, our users can use this application to record their health data and track
    their data with a user-friendly dashboard even export their data for external use for free.
    Besides, our users from all around the world can contact or navigate to their nearby hospital,
    police station and more with a click without having a long time of searching when they are
    having an emergency issue. Moreover, our users can also have full access to the resources of
    first aid, healthcare and more in the form of text, video and more for free.

    We hope you enjoy our mobile application as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have
    any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
